# Chrome mouse gesture extension
I've been using crxMouse for many years and it serves me well. And recently it has gone rouged by sending lots of analytics stuffs to it's server. hence I've decided to build my own.

This is rather simple gesture control build using rxjs v6 it only does this 5 things that I use daily in chrome.

- **Gesture LEFT** - Page back 
- **Gesture Right** - Page forward
- **Gesture Up** Open new tab
- **Gesture Down** Close current tab
- **Gesture Up, Down** Undo close tab

to use it just hold right mouse button and drag UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT and then release to trigger above command in chrome.

If I have time then I'll enhance more to allow OPTION for customizations.

Right now, it's enough for my use.

I grant you the right to steal this codes and make it your own. a little credit will be enough.
